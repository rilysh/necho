** necho
A POSIX 1003.1-2008 "based" echo for Unix-like systems.

*** Why?
In most shells, =echo= is a built-in command, means that, you
don't invoke the actual echo program, but rather a "feature
function" provided by the shell.

The reason of necho's existence, is that, generic =echo= programs
whether provided in the GNU/Linux or BSD system (especially BSD)
doesn't handle backslash characters. However, they do have a special
argument and that's "-n". This version of echo combines both
POSIX 1003.1-2008 and the generic echo.
